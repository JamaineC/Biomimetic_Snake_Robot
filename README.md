# Biomimetic_Snake_Robot
A major project from my AI and Robotics course at Aberystwyth University. Developed a biomimetic snake robot using C++ and Webots. Implemented locomotion with harmonic motion, phase shifts, IMU-based control, and obstacle avoidance. Explored real-world applications and challenges. Includes analysis, iterative design, and sensor integration.
